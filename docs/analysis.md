Copilot Prompt: Monthly Analysis Component (Budget Planner App)
Objective

Generate a Monthly Analysis component in an Angular-based Budget Planner application that closely matches the provided UI reference image.

Component Purpose

This component should analyze a logged-in user’s financial data for a selected month and present insights visually and textually.

All calculations and comparisons must be handled by the backend

Frontend should focus only on UI rendering and interactions

Frontend (Angular) Requirements
1. Component Details

Component Name: MonthlyAnalysisComponent

Location:
src/app/features/analysis/monthly-analysis

2. Month Selector

Dropdown or selector allowing users to choose a month (January, February, March, etc.)

When the month changes:

Fetch analysis data for that specific month

Update charts and recommendations dynamically

Only data for the selected month should be displayed

3. Expense Breakdown Pie Chart

Display a pie chart showing expense distribution for the selected month

Each category should have:

A distinct color

A square color indicator next to the category name and amount

Example categories:

Food

Rent

Entertainment

The pie chart must:

Reflect only the selected month

Show data only for the currently logged-in user

4. Summary Cards (Recommended)

Display cards similar to the reference UI:

Total Income

Total Expenses

Total Savings

Savings Rate (%)

All values must reflect only the selected month

5. Recommendations Section

Display recommendation cards generated by the backend

Each recommendation should include:

An icon (up arrow, down arrow, tip, success)

Highlighted percentage or amount

Short explanatory message

Example:

“You spent 20% more on Entertainment than last month.”

“Great job! You saved $100 more than last month.”

6. Insufficient Data Handling

If the user has less than two months of income and expense data:

Do NOT generate recommendations

Show a UI message such as:

“Not enough data to generate recommendations. Please track income and expenses for at least two months.”

Backend (.NET API) Requirements
1. Monthly Analysis Endpoint

Create an endpoint that returns:

Total income (selected month)

Total expenses (selected month)

Savings and savings rate

Expense breakdown by category

Recommendations (if applicable)

2. Recommendations Service

Create a RecommendationsService inside the Services folder

This service should:

Compare the selected month with the previous month

Generate meaningful insights

Examples:

“You spent 20% more on Food this month compared to last month.”

“You saved $100 more this month — keep it up!”

“Consider reducing dining expenses to improve savings.”

3. Recommendation Logic Rules

Recommendations should only be generated if:

Both current and previous month data exist

Compare:

Category-wise expense changes (percentage-based)

Savings improvement or decline

Return human-readable messages, not raw numbers

4. Security & User Context

All calculations must be scoped to the logged-in user

Backend must use authenticated user context (UserId)

Frontend must not send UserId explicitly

Architecture Rules

Business logic → Backend only

Calculations & comparisons → Backend

UI rendering → Frontend

Clean separation of concerns

UI Style Guidelines

Card-based layout

Rounded corners

Subtle shadows

Clean typography

Soft, modern color palette

Professional and academic-quality UI suitable for a master’s project

End Goal

A clean, professional Monthly Analysis feature that:

Explains spending behavior clearly

Provides actionable recommendations

Uses month-over-month comparison

Matches the attached UI reference closely
